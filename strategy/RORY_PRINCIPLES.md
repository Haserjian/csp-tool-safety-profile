# Rory Sutherland Operating Principles for CSP

> "A flower is simply a weed with an advertising budget."

This document captures behavioral/psychological principles from Rory Sutherland's work, adapted for CSP adoption strategy. The core insight: **the bottleneck is usually psychological, not technical.**

## 10 Operating Principles

### 1. Meaning beats mechanics
People don't respond to the *thing*—they respond to what the thing *signals* (status, care, safety, identity, taste). Treat "perception work" as real work, not decoration.

**CSP application:** The receipt isn't just audit data—it's proof of diligence. The badge isn't just compliance—it's status signal.

### 2. Opposites can both be true (context makes the winner)
In human systems, there isn't one global optimum—there are multiple local optima. Run paired experiments that are *deliberately opposite* to reveal which "world" your users are in.

**CSP application:** "Strict + formal + court-grade" vs "fast + playful + hacker-friendly" can both work for different segments.

### 3. Never design for the imaginary average person
The "average user" is a hallucination. Build for a specific outlier you can describe, delight them, then let diffusion do its thing.

**CSP application:** Design for the security engineer who needs to convince their CISO, not the "average developer."

### 4. Efficiency is not effectiveness
The stuff that looks "wasteful" can be the signal that creates trust (time taken, ceremony, constraint, polish, proof). Don't optimize away the cues that make people feel safe choosing you.

**CSP application:** The Guardian check ceremony IS the product. The receipt minting IS the value. Don't minimize them.

### 5. Expectation is part of the product
Set expectations on purpose (what you are / aren't, who it's for, the "job" it does). Expectation mismatches create "bad product" experiences even when the product is fine.

**CSP application:** "This is governance infrastructure, not an agent framework." Clear positioning prevents wrong-fit frustration.

### 6. If everyone is being logical, logic makes you identical
Logic drives convergence → commodity → price wars. Differentiation often comes from a psycho-logical move your competitors are too "reasonable" to try.

**CSP application:** Everyone else is racing to ship agent features. We're shipping the law agents run under.

### 7. Logic can kill the best solutions
"Magic" = psychological leverage you can get without changing the core tech. When humans are involved, insisting on purely mechanistic justification is how you miss the real win.

**CSP application:** The badge creates trust through visibility, not through cryptographic proof that anyone reads.

### 8. Create a safe sandbox for "weird tests"
The trick is not *being* irrational; it's giving yourself a small, low-risk lane where you can try "embarrassing" ideas and keep the ones that work.

**CSP application:** Run experiments in the README, quickstart, and onboarding—low cost, high signal.

### 9. Use more than one lever (humans aren't one-dimensional)
Price/incentives are just one lever. Other clubs: defaults, friction, reassurance, status, narrative, social proof, identity, timing.

**CSP application:** Guardian-as-default, badge-as-status, receipt-as-reassurance, conformance-as-identity.

### 10. If a logical answer existed, you'd already have it
When a problem persists, it's often "logic-proof." The next move is a reframing move, not a bigger spreadsheet.

**CSP application:** Agent safety isn't an unsolved technical problem—it's an unsolved trust/proof/accountability problem.

## CSP-Specific Psycho-Logical Plays

### The "Receipt as Status Symbol" Play
Make the badge something people WANT to display, not just compliance theater. SOC2 badges became status signals. CSP badges can too.

### The "Dangerous Default" Inversion
Most tools default to permissive. CSP defaults to restrictive. This is a feature—the ceremony of restriction creates trust.

### The "Proof Porn" Content Strategy
Show the receipts. Make them beautiful. Make people want to screenshot and share them. The receipt IS the marketing.

### The "Enterprise Whisper Network" Play
Don't market to enterprises directly. Market to the security engineer who will champion it internally. They need ammunition (receipts, badges, conformance reports) to convince their boss.

### The "Anti-Demo" Demo
Instead of showing CSP working, show CSP STOPPING something dangerous. The drama of prevention > the boredom of success.

### The "Compliance Theater Arbitrage"
Most compliance is theater—checklists and attestations. CSP is actual cryptographic proof. Position against the theater, not against non-compliance.

### The "Guardian as Character"
Give the Guardian personality. It's not just code—it's the entity that watches your back. Anthropomorphize the safety layer.

### The "Receipt Wall"
Public feed of anonymized receipts showing what got blocked. Social proof that the system works. "X CRITICAL commands blocked this week."

### The "Court-Grade Flex"
Make "court-grade" the aspirational tier. Basic is fine, but court-grade is what serious people use. Status through rigor.

### The "One Pager for the CISO"
A receipt-backed conformance report that a security engineer can email to their CISO. The artifact IS the sales tool.
