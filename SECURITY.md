# Security Policy

## Scope
This repository is a **specification only** (no production code or runtime). There are no SLAs or security guarantees implied by this repo.

## Reporting Issues
- For spec ambiguities, gaps, or safety concerns: open a GitHub Issue.
- Do **not** include private or sensitive data in issues.
- Vulnerability reports for sample JSON/snippets are out of scope; no executable release is maintained here.

## Operational Guidance
If you implement the Assay Protocol:
- Follow your own org’s vuln disclosure and incident response processes.
- Treat any implementation as you would other security-sensitive infrastructure (logging, secrets management, review/approval of changes).
